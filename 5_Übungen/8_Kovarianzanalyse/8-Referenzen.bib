  abstract = {We report an extensive study which compares cognitive therapy, antidepressantdrugs and a combination of these two, in depressedpatients seen either in general practice or an out-patient department. One-hundred and forty patients were screened for primary major depression and 64 patients completed the trial. All were rated on seven measures of mood, in@Iudingindependent observer-rated and self-rated depression and scales of anxiety and irritability. Patients were randomly assigned to cognitive therapy, antidepressants or a combination of the two. The antidepressant drug group did less well in both hospital and general practice and combination treatment was superior to drug treatment in both hospital and general practice. In general practice, cognitive therapy was superior to drug treatment. The presence of endogenous features did not affect responseto treatment. The results are discussed in terms of Beck's cognitive \^a\texteuro\texttildelow\textquestiondown theofrydepression and factors of presumed causal importance of depressionin general practice.},
